  Hello there! I'm Tiago Lino Bello, a PhD student at Numerical Methods in Engineering
  Graduate Program (PPGMNE) from the Federal Univeristy of Paran치 since 2019, under
  the supervision of PhD Luiz Carlos Matioli. I got licensed degree in Mathematics at the State University
  of Paran치 (UNESPAR) at 2017 and a Master degree in Numerical Methods in Engineering at Federal
  University of Paran치 at 2019.

  Right now, I am member of the following research groups: Grupo de Pesquisa em Matem치tica
  Pura e Aplicada (UNESPAR) and LYNX Research Group.

  I and very interested about topics involving optimization (OPT), operational research (OR)
  and statistical learning (SL) methods, which are all the topics I am working right now
  for my thesis.

  If you are interested, check my CV for more =).
